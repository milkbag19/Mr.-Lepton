Mr. Lepton is a Discord bot aimed to be user friendly, and packed with features.  This was my first attempt at a discord bot, only have limited experince with JavaScript through my work experience with Fullstack web development.  Instead of using more modern technologies, such as Node.js which this bot is written in, I had to use PHP, so there was not many chances to get familiar with the language.  

Mr. Lepton has many features and commands, such as :

# Economy 

- Experience 

Exp is used to track your progress to the next level.

**What are levels used for?**

Good question!

When you level up, you are granted coins, which may be used to gamble.

A shop is on its way to spend these coins :)

**How do I get Exp?**

The main way to gather Exp is by talking and interacting in the many discord servers that Mr. Lepton are in!

One other way is by gambling!

- Gambling

The main purpose of gambling is to allow users to gather coins faster, but at their own risk.

Will you become a coin millionare? or will you become homeless from you gambling addiction?
